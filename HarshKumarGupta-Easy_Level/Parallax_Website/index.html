        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>Parallax effects involve a websiteâ€™s background moving at a different speed than the foreground content.
            Basically in this parallax website we are showing the earth's images .
            Also we want to discuss about the Global warming in the Second section.

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>Global warming will result in more frequent hot days and fewer cool days, with the greatest warming occurring
            over land. Longer, more intense heat waves will become more common. Storms, floods, and droughts will
            generally be more severe as precipitation patterns change. Hurricanes may increase in intensity due to
            warmer ocean surface temperatures. In section third we have discuss about the prevent of globle warming.

        <p>Some simple yet effective ways to prevent global warming:<br />
            1 Reduce Energy Consumption.<br />
            2 Conserve Water.<br />
            3 Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - Reduce your consumption of single-use plastics and packaging materials.<br />
            4 Support Renewable Energy - Invest in solar panels or wind turbines for your home or business.
